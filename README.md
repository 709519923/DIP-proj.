# DIP-proj.

This is my end-of-programme project named 'Road vehicle monitoring and license plate detection', it used me about 5-7 days to achieve all. All of the source material come from Internet, expecially in the blog——CSDN and github. Many places in my code exist defect. If you meet some doubts when you refer to my code, please send e-mail to 709519923@qq.com. I would like to communicate your problems.
